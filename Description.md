# Sea It Rise: A Coastal Resiliency Planning App

# Short Description:

Sea It Rise enables you to plan for sea level rise impacts 
using your smartphone as a data collection and visualization 
device.

# Updates and Improvements

## Background and Motivation
The seas are rising and will rise faster later this century. The historical data 
is clear and the scientific consensus is unequivocal. Even so, the rate of change 
is small, and the desire to adapt to sea level increase is not overwhelming. This 
is unfortunate because sea level rise directly affects public safety, local 
fisheries, shipping and trade. Indeed, since human society has flourished during a 
period of relative sea level stability, almost all our coastal infrastructure and 
livelihoods are built around the current height of the ocean. Unfortunately, if often 
takes serious weather events like Hurricane Katrina or Tropical Storm Harvey to remind 
us of the fragility of that infrastructure.

One problem that exists is the simple fact that “seeing is believing”. While the seas 
rise and fall each day with the comings and goings of the tide, the slow increase 
caused by sea level rise is small, almost imperceptible. The difficulty of 
observing these changes is understandable, as anyone who lives along the coast 
can attest. Perhaps you have begun a nice walk down the beach that became a wet 
and wild adventure when you forgot to pay attention to the incoming tide. Or maybe 
the kayak you pulled way up the beach floated away when you neglected to tie it off. 
Neither of those situations is the result of some massive tidal surge, but rather 
the impact of slowly increasing water levels sneaking up on you.

The basic premise of Sea It Rise is to use your smartphone as a "viewer" of sea level 
rise impact, using a simple overlay to indicate future water levels. Wondering what your 
favorite beach might look like after a couple of feet of sea level rise? Pull out 
your smartphone, fire up the app and see whether you are standing in a future puddle. 
Want to record what the beach looks like when the closest tidal gauge 
is at a certain height? Snap a picture, add a note and upload to an archive of other 
shoreline pictures taken with the app. Want to compare to other tidal heights? 
Browse the map for other images taken nearby. Engaging individuals 
in collecting their own data sparks conversations and interest in a way that 
showing a map of areas impacted by future sea level rise does not.

We believe that Sea It Rise fits well into the Education and Public Safety categories
of the HeroX Big Ocean Button Challenge. If you spend any time in and around the 
water and/or planning field excursions, finding areas that might be impacted by sea 
level rise is greatly facilitated by this app, including the ability to see photos 
from others at that location as well as viewing tide and current predictions for 
the site of interest. Coastal planners, environmental science teachers and beach 
naturalist programs could all use this our application to make their activities 
more meaningful. Allowing students or participants to become data collectors 
and see their work recognized can further motivate them to learn more about 
coastal resiliency and what changes and approaches might help mitigate future 
impacts.

### Improvements
Sea It Rise has evolved considerably since the prototype submission in September 2017
and the final public vote at the end of October. Our initial strategy of developing 
and HTML5 app paid off by allowing fast interations and flexibility. 

One significant improvement of the user experience and overall data mashup for Sea
It Rise was to incorporate hashtag searching on Flickr to find photos with #hightide,
#lowtide, #surf and #seaitrise tags. Integration from Flickr to the Sea It Rise web-app
was fairly quick, and a similar strategy could work well for Twitter hashtags as well. 
Since users are particularly interested in posting "WOW!" photos and tagging them using 
Twitter and Flickr, these markers may serve to highlight coastal areas that are 
particularly sensitive to storm and/or high tide events. One can imagine that a 
small social marketing hashtag campaign from HeroX or other partners would greatly
expand awareness and help the general public become more aware of the need to 
plan for coastal resiliency.

### Future Plans
The web application is now feature complete (although continually improving) and the 
Android performance is significantly better, which motivates us to make native apps
that have feature parity to the HTML5 environment.


*** iPhone and Android compatible. 
*** Fast iteration and experimentation happens here.
